        In the year 1985, Dr. Emmet Brown had a dream for the future. One so bold that it would change the very foundation of our society: a solution for clean energy that and waste that pollutes our society. At once, he set to work on the Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor. Developed over the course of seven years, this revolutionary machine can take any type of waste and transform it into renewable energy. In order to better manufacture and keep up with the ever-changing landscape of technology, Dr. Brown started the Mr. Fusion Home Energy Company. Through this, he has hired some of the brightest minds in the world to help further the future of clean energy. Once a dream in the mind of a brilliant man, the Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor is poised to change the world as we know it.
